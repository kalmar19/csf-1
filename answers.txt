Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:
Our variables that we needed for the function was no longer define. Therefore it gives you the error lenenum is not define.

When I comment out gc_count = 0 it would give me gc_count not defined error as well. The gc_count is a define variable that counts up the total. 
Therefore it must give it a variable 0 since we want the total count. 


Problem 4:

I  duplicate the loop that was already there. Not sure if I did this right.

This hw was really hard for me, I was confused on how to get started. Using the command line was something that I wasn't used to. Worked with Tutors and Trong.
